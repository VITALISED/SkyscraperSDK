# SkyscraperSDK

Work in progress SDK for No Man's Sky based on the `4.13` Fractal Debug Build (read more [here](https://nomansskyretro.com/wiki/Fractal_Update_Debug_Version)).

Probably won't work on latest (which as I write this is Interceptor `4.20` I think?) and I might be too lazy to port it to newer builds but who knows
